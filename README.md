# 3x2

This simple game made in **JavaScript** (my first project in the language) involves a 3x2 pixel playing field. 
You play as the orange "knight" who weilds a blue "sword", defeating the red "enemies" and keeping his green "allies" safe.
Use the arrow keys to control your character. The only keys used are the **up** arrow, **right** arrow, and **enter** to restart.
